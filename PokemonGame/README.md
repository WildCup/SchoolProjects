# PokemonGame
 
A turn-based game on the console. (Sth like Pokemon game).

Player chooses their team out of 15 monsters and fights with the computer's team. The game has 4-6 rounds each with 4-6 enemy monsters to defeat.

Each monster has special abilities like a shield, poison, revive, summon, etc. 
Abilities are passive or active and may have inf. or finitely many uses.

There are 6 elements: Water, Earth, Air, Fire, Ice, and Steel. 
Table strong-weak effectiveness against each other can be found in listed below pdf.

The enemy's behavior is random, but the enemy won't try attacking a monster that is already dead, etc. Better combat AI may be provided soon if I have time (like attacking most dangerous monsters first or trying to finish off low-hp ones).

I have to say some monsters (especially their abilities) are stronger than others, but still, game balance is good enough to be fun to play. And even if you choose the strongest monster, winning the whole game on hard is difficult since you don't heal every round.

Saving and loading are supported.

This game is my first project for C++ classes at my university. A detailed description can be found in Turn-based-Game.pdf

This project is finished and was graded with a maximum score. But I may upgrade it a bit since there is some stuff which I'd like to change.
