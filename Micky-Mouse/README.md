# Micky-Mouse
 
The game-like Micky-Mouse but with custom graphics: you catch primogems moving Hu Tao^^

The project uses JavaFX but without FXML files (that was established by my teacher).

The project was a task for my university PJATK and its details can be found in 2122l_GUI_FTS_PRO3.pdf

Some technologies used are: animation, saving ranking, serialization, and JavaFX components...


The project is not finished yet. I'll update it soon.
